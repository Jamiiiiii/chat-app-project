This is a chat-app made to look similar to whatsapp. There is Clerk used for authorization, Convex for database and Typescript to build the web application. This works just fine on desktop/laptop but it's not very responsive so it doesnt look as good on mobile (I will fix this with time). 

When you open the site it will ask you to log in with Google account for security reasons. 
You can create 1 on 1 or group chats with anyone who was logged in with google.
You can also use chatgbt to answer your questions, just write @gbt "your question"
You can use dall-e to create a picture for you, just write @dall-e "your description of the image"

Feel free to explore my simple web app! :)
